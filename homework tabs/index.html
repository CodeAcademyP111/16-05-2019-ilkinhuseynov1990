                Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital and most populous city of
                France, with an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and an official estimated population of
                2,140,526 residents as of 1 January 2019.[1] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's
                major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts.

                The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has
                an estimated official 2019 population of 12,213,364, or about 18 percent of the population of France.[1]
                The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017.[3] According to the Economist
                Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in
                the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zurich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva.[4] Another source ranked
                Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.[5]

                The city is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports:
                Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe) and Paris-Orly.[6][7] Opened in 1900, the
                city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily,[8] and is the second
                busiest metro system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station in
                the world, and the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[9]

                Japan (Japanese: 日本; Nippon [ɲippoɴ] or Nihon [ɲihoɴ]; formally 日本国 About this soundNippon-koku or
                Nihon-koku, lit. "State of Japan") is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it
                lies off the eastern coast of the Asian continent and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to
                the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea in the south.

                The kanji that make up Japan's name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising
                Sun". Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands. The four largest are
                Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area and
                often are referred to as home islands. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions, with
                Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and Okinawa being the southernmost one. Japan is the 2nd most
                populous island country. The population of 127 million is the world's eleventh largest, of which 98.5%
                are ethnic Japanese. 90.7% of people live in cities, while 9.3% live in the countryside.[16] About 13.8
                million people live in Tokyo,[17] the capital of Japan. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous
                metropolitan area in the world with over 38 million people.[18]

                Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The
                first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other
                regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has
                characterized Japan's history.

                From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shōguns who ruled in the
                name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was
                ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades
                of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through
                the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma – and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late
                19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and
                World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second
                Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945
                following the Japanese surrender. Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3, 1947, during the
                occupation led by SCAP, the sovereign state of Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary
                constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.
